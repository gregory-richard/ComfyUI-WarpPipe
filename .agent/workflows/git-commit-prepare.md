description: Prepare the project for a commit
---

Please prepare the project for a commit. You need to do the following:

- Increase the version number based on Semantic Versioning:
  - **Major (1.0.0)**: Breaking changes (incompatible API or feature removal).
  - **Minor (0.1.0)**: New features (backward compatible).
  - **Patch (0.0.1)**: Bug fixes or small tweaks (backward compatible).
- Update the CHANGELOG.md
- Update the README.md (if necessary)
- Update the WIKI.md (if necessary)
- Provide a commit message.

NEVER commit yourself, unless explicitly asked to do so.
